#### Giving Notion Calendar permission to access your Google account

Notion Calendar asks only for the Google permissions that we absolutely need to make sure Notion Calendar works properly. These permissions are only used to access data on your behalf, never to read, edit, or delete it without direct action from you.Notion Calendar is verified by Google and can’t access any user data categorized as restricted. We’ll never see your Google password. You also have the ability to remove access at any time.Learn more about how we protect your data here →

Here are the permissions we require to run Notion Calendar effectively. Once you give these permissions at first login, you won’t have to do it again.

If you’re told something went wrong when signing in with Google, try signing in again in a different browser. You can also select `Sign into another account` and try again with the same credentials.

If you get an authorization error when signing in with Google with a work email, it might be because an admin hasn’t approved Notion Calendar to be authorized with Google at your organization yet. To fix this issue, admins can:

  -Sign intoadmin.google.comwith their admin credentials.

  -Go to `Security` → `Access and data control` → `API controls` → `Manage Google services` .

# Manage your calendars & events

### Here’s how to set up your calendar so you can get around the grid quickly and focus on what matters most to you 🏃🏼‍♂️

### Manage your calendars

You can connect multiple Google Calendar accounts to Notion Calendar. Connected accounts and their calendars are listed in the left sidebar of Notion Calendar. You can collapse accounts, reorder them, and reorder calendars within them.

#### Add another Google Calendar account

To add another Google Calendar account to Notion Calendar, go to `Settings` → `Calendars` and select `Connect` next to `Add Google Calendar account` .

Note:

  -If you’re unable to add more than five calendars to Notion Calendar, this is because performance can be affected past this number.

  -At this time, it’s not possible to subscribe to a new calendar from inside Notion Calendar. Subscribe to a calendar directly from Google Calendar, and it’ll show up in Notion Calendar.



#### Remove a Google Calendar account

You can remove any Google Calendar account from Notion Calendar except your primary Google account. To do this, go to `Settings` → `Calendars` . Next to the calendar you want to remove, select `Disconnect` .

Want to change your primary Google account?Follow the instructions here →

#### Set a default calendar

Notion Calendar defaults to a calendar when you create new events. To set a default calendar, go to `Settings` → `Calendars` → `Default calendar` and pick the calendar you want to set as your default — this can be aNotion database, too! On desktop, you can also set a default calendar by clicking the square next to a calendar’s name in the left sidebar.

#### Hide a calendar

If you want to hide a calendar, select `👁️` next to its name. This will take all events on that calendar away from view and the icon will have a strikethrough. To show a calendar, select `👁️` again.

#### Change a calendar's color or name

On desktop or web, select a calendar, then enter a new name or select a new color.

### Manage your events

Note:On mobile, you can’t update an event’s details unless they were created on mobile and you’re the organizer. If you need to make changes, you can do so on desktop or web.

#### Create events

To create an event in Notion Calendar, select a time slot in your calendar, then enter details for your event. If there are participants other than yourself, you can select `Send invite` to invite them. If you want to create a focus or out of office block, open the dropdown next to `Event` and choose your desired event type.

If you’re on mobile, select `+` at the bottom right of the app, then enter details for your event. To finish, select `Done` , or `Send invite` if you’ve added other participants.

Note:Only certain types of Google accounts can be used to create Focus events. Learn morehere →

Create multiple-day events with start and end times

To create multiple-day events with time details, select a time slot in your calendar, then drag it across the days the event will span. Once the event is created, you can enter start and end times for it.

Note:You can use headers, hyperlinks, numbered and bulleted lists, and more in your event description.

#### RSVP to events

To respond to a calendar invite, right-click the event on desktop or select the event on mobile, then select your RSVP status.

If you’re the event organizer, your RSVP status will automatically be `Yes` . To change your status, select the arrows next to your name in the event details on desktop. On mobile, select the event, then select a new RSVP status.

You can also add a note after you’ve RSVPed to an event. To do this, select an event, then select `✏️` next to the RSVP options. Enter your note in the text field. Once you’re done, select `Send update` to share the note with other participants via email. If you don’t want an email to be sent, open the dropdown next to `Send update` and select `Send update without email` .

Select an event to see any RSVP notes for it.

If the same event shows up on more than one of your calendars — that is, if they share the same event ID — Notion Calendar will merge those events automatically.If an event has been auto-merged and you want to RSVP from a specific calendar, hide your other calendars and RSVP from the calendar that’s visible.

#### Change an event's location

To add or remove the location for an event, select the event and edit the `Location` field in the right context panel.

#### Change your status and event privacy

Select an event. Then, in the right context panel, show your status as `Busy` or `Free` . You can also make your event’s details visible to others by making them `Public` , or only to yourself and other participants by making them `Private` .

#### Change your event type

In Notion Calendar, there are three kinds of events: `Event` , `Focus time` , or `Out of office` . You can change your event type at any time using Notion Calendar on desktop or web. To change your event type, click on the event, open the dropdown next to the event type, and choose your desired event type.

Note:At this time, Focus and OOO events are only available to Notion Calendar users with work or school accounts managed by Google Workspace.

#### Email participants

Select an event, then select `•••` at the top right of the right context panel → `Email participants` . This will open a mailto: link.

On Mac, this defaults to the Mail app. To change this:

  -Open the Mail app.

  -Go to `Settings...` .

  -Open the dropdown next to `Default email reader` and select your preferred email client.

To update to Gmail in Chrome:

  -Go to Gmail.

  -Click the two diamonds in the URL bar. If you don’t see this, enter `chrome://settings/handlers` into your URL bar and allow Gmail handle protocols, then try again.

  -Select `Allow` .

#### Mark participant as optional

Select an event, then add a participant to it from the right context panel. Then, select `•••` next to their name → `Mark optional` .

If an event appears on multiple calendars, and you want to edit the event from an account that is not your primary account, toggle off the other calendars in your calendar list in the left sidebar so only the calendar that you want to use to edit is visible.

#### Move an event to a different calendar

Because Notion Calendar brings all of your commitments together in one place, it’s easy to move an event from one calendar to another. To do this:

  -Select an event.

  -In the right context panel, click on the name of the current calendar

  -In the dropdown, select a new calendar for the event.

#### Bulk edit events

You can take action on multiple events at a time. These include changing their color or blocking them on another calendar. To do this:

  -Hold `shift` while using Notion Calendar on desktop or web, then select multiple events.

  -Right-click, then select the action you want to take.

You can also shift multiple events over on your calendar. To do this:

  -Hold `shift` while using Notion Calendar on desktop or web, then select multiple events.

  -Drag the events to their desired time slots. They’ll all move together.

# Availability, blocking & time zones

### Notion Calendar allows you to easily set up time with others and let others know when you are or aren’t available. It also lets you see your schedule across different time zones and quickly travel to a new one ✈️

### Share availability

On desktop and web, you can quickly indicate and share your availability directly from inside Notion Calendar to make it easier to schedule meetings with others.

To share your availability with someone:

  -Select `Share availability` in your right context panel, or use the keyboard shortcut `S` .

  -Select open time slots in your calendar.

  -Set a name for the event you want to schedule during one of these time slots, as well as duration, the invitee’s time zone, and conferencing details.

  -Select `Create` on your availability. Calendar holds will be placed for your available dates and times so you can keep that time available for your invitees.

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/1p74I33hfqqMF1w3C8QDAg/c06e4a656167ca08a2fae987f4663937/scheduling_snippet_2.mp4)

Notion Calendar won’t automatically detect changes to your calendar and update your availability, so make sure to keep your availability up to date as your schedule changes.

#### Scheduling snippet

As you mark your availability and provide details for the meeting you’re trying to schedule, a message will automatically populate at the top of your right context panel. Select `•••` → `Copy snippet` to save this message to your clipboard. You can paste this and send it to your invitees in an email, text message, and more.

#### Scheduling link

Turn on `Scheduling link` to generate a link that your invitees can go to to confirm when they’d like to meet with you. When turned on, this link will be included in your scheduling snippet. You can also select `•••` → `Copy scheduling link` to quickly send it to someone. When your invitees visit your link, they’ll see your snippet along with your availability. They can choose a time slot that works for them. Then, your meeting with them will automatically appear on your calendar, and any unnecessary calendar holds will be released.

Note: At this time, it’s not possible to:

  -Indicate or take into account the availabilities of people other than yourself.

  -Change the content of your snippet.

  -Create multiple or repeat bookings using the same scheduling link.

We’re working on improving the share availability experience, and we’ll keep you updated athttps://www.notion.so/releasesandhttps://twitter.com/notioncalendar.

### Blocking

Have a doctor’s appointment that you don’t want a teammate to schedule over? Notion Calendar’s blocking features make it easy to block events across your various calendars. For example, Notion Calendar can put a block on your work calendar for an event you have on your personal calendar, so people know you’re busy without being able to see your personal commitments. You can block single events or auto-block whole calendars.

#### Block an event or an entire calendar

On desktop or web:

  -Right-click an event and select `Block on calendar` .

  -Select the calendar you want to create a block in.

  -To create a block for a single event, select `This event` . Alternatively, you can select `All events from {calendar name}` to set up auto-blocking. For example, if you are creating a block on your work calendar for an event on your personal calendar, you can synchronize the two calendars so that all future events from your personal calendar will be blocked on your work calendar.

  -Choose to `Include details` from the original calendar event in the block, or simply `Show as busy` . This will apply to future blocks if you choose to auto-block.

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/2nHP24YLWO6wcqf02lErUJ/4e33bd41a6518e011eb9448d619bc15f/event_blocking.mp4)

To see what details you’ve shared on a calendar block, right-click the original event and select Block on calendar. There will be a `🔒` next to the calendar where the block was set up — if the lock is open, that means the event’s details have been shared. If the lock is closed, that means the event’s details are hidden.

Alternatively, you can hide the original calendar from view by selecting the eye icon next to its name in the left sidebar. Then, you can find the block on your other calendar and see its details.

#### Remove blocking

You can remove blocks the same way you created them. Right-click a blocked event and unselect the calendar where the block lives. You can unblock a single event, or turn off auto-blocking by unblocking all events.

You may want to undo auto-blocking for a calendar that you no longer have access to. We’re working to improve this experience, but in the meantime you can reach out toteam@makenotion.com.

### Time zones

In Notion Calendar, time zones are first-class citizens. You can add multiple time zones to your calendar, give them custom labels, and even temporarily travel to time zones.

#### Primary time zone

Note: When you set up Notion Calendar for the first time, we get your primary time zone from Google Calendar. After that, any changes you make to your time zones in Notion Calendar won’t be reflected in Google Calendar, and vice versa.

Events on your calendar are displayed in your primary time zone. This time zone is displayed directly to the left of your calendar.

#### Add a time zone

Use the keyboard shortcut `cmd/ctrl` + `K` and enter “time zone” for quick access to time zone features.

Any new time zones you display on your calendar are secondary time zones. To add a time zone, select `+` next to your primary time zone. Select your desired time zone from the list that appears. This time zone will appear next to your other time zones.

If you’re on mobile, select the time zone on the very left of your calendar, then select `Add time zone` .

If you want to have more than four total time zones shown in your calendar,follow the instructions here →

#### Edit or remove a time zone

Right-click a time zone, then:

  -Select `Change` to replace it with another time zone.

  -Select `Rename` to give your time zone another name.

  -Select `Make time zone primary` . This will bring this time zone closest to your calendar, and move any other time zones to the left.

  -Select `Remove time zone from list` .

#### Reorder your time zones

On desktop, you can rearrange your time zones by selecting and dragging them.The right-most time zone will become your primary time zone.

#### Travel to a time zone

Use the keyboard shortcut `Z` to travel to a new time zone. This time zone will temporarily become your primary time zone. You can permanently add this time zone to your calendar by right-clicking on it and selecting `Add as primary time zone` or `Add as secondary time zone` .

#### Update time zones on mobile

To make changes to time zones on Notion Calendar for mobile, select a time zone, then select `Make time zone secondary` , `Make time zone primary` , `Add time zone` , or `Remove time zone` .

# Notion Calendar conferencing integrations & API

### Notion Calendar works with a lot of other tools that you already use in your day to day. It also works seamlessly with Notion 🔌

Did you know you can use Notion Calendar with Notion?Learn more here →

### Conferencing integrations

For the best experience with setting up conferencing integrations and adding conferencing links to events, use Notion Calendar on desktop or web.

Notion Calendar integrates with conferencing tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and many more. There are three types of conferencing integrations in Notion Calendar:

  -Default integrations: Conferencing that is available to you by default from your calendar provider. Google Meet, which is linked to Google Calendar, is one example.

  -Connected integrations: An integration you can set up by logging into a conferencing tool. New events you create on desktop or web will generate new links for this conference tool from within Notion Calendar. Zoom is an example of a connected integration that Notion Calendar supports.

  -Custom integrations: You can add a stable conferencing link for a conferencing tool of your choice by going to `Settings` → `Conferencing` → `Conferencing providers` → `Add` . You can give your integration a name. This conferencing tool will show up in the conferencing dropdown when you create events. Any stable links will work, but Notion Calendar can detect popular services, includingAround,BlueJeans,Doxy.me,Microsoft Teams,Skype,Webex, andWhereby.

Note:If an event contains conferencing links in both its description and conferencing field, you’ll be taken to the link from the event’s description when you join a meeting from Notion Calendar.

#### Set a default conferencing option

A default conferencing option allows you to automatically add conferencing to an event that has at least one other participant when you’re using Notion Calendar on desktop. To set Zoom as this default option, go to `Settings` → `Conferencing` → `Default conferencing` , then in the dropdown, select `Zoom` .

#### Zoom

Connect your Zoom account

To connect your Zoom and Notion Calendar accounts, go to `Settings` → `Conferencing` . Find `Zoom` and select `Configure` . When you’re redirected to your browser, make sure you’re logged in with the right Zoom account, then select `Authorize` to give Notion Calendar access.

Notion Calendar asks only for theZoom permissionsthat we absolutely need to make sure the integration with Notion Calendar works properly. These permissions are only used to allow you to connect your account and add Zoom meetings to events.Learn more about our security practices here →

Passcode settings

If you’ve enabled the use of Personal Meeting IDs (PMIs) in yourZoom Profile Settings, Notion Calendar will use your configured stable PMI and passcode when adding a Zoom link to a meeting. If this setting is off in Zoom, Notion Calendar will protect your Zoom calls with a secure, one-time PIN and include it in the meeting for you and participants to join with a single click. Notion Calendar generates these PINs according to your Zoom admin'spasscode complexity requirements.

Disconnect your Zoom account

To stop using your Zoom account with Notion Calendar, go to `Settings` → `Conferencing` . Find Zoom and select `Disconnect` .

If you remove Notion Calendar from your installed apps in Zoom App Marketplace, we will follow Zoom'sdeauthorization and data complianceguidelines.

Note:

  -If you’re having trouble authorizing Notion Calendar as you set up the integration, have an admin sign intomarketplace.zoom.us, search for Notion Calendar, and turn on `Pre-approve` .

  -Currently, when you join a meeting in the Zoom app from Notion Calendar, your video will be turned off by default.

  -If you have any problems joining a meeting, try disconnecting then reconnecting your Zoom account.



#### Google Meet

Because Notion Calendar is already connected to your Google account, you don’t need to do anything else to add Google Meet links to your meetings! Even if you’ve connected multiple Google accounts to Notion Calendar, Notion Calendar will make sure you’re joining meetings across your various calendars from the right Google account.

Note:If you don’t see Google Meet as a conferencing option in Notion Calendar, it might mean your Google Workspace doesn’t have Google Meet enabled. Reach out to an admin toturn on Meet video calling.



### Notion integration

Notion Calendar can be used with Notion. Add Notion pages to your event details for easy access and view important dates from Notion databases directly in Notion Calendar so you don’t have to track your database events separately from your other important plans.Learn more here →

### Notion Calendar API

Notion Calendar has a simple local API you can use to open Notion Calendar to a specific event from another tool. This works on desktop, on both macOS and Windows.

Here is an example schema:

`cron://showEvent?accountEmail=test@example.com&iCalUID=51p9lhpkrerfom8cqn9g1btjuu@google.com&startDate=2022-01-05T20:30:00.000Z&endDate2022-01-05T21:00:00.000Z&title=Test&ref=com.example.test`

  -Give Notion Calendar access to Notion by selecting `Allow access` . If the integration is successful, you’ll see it appear in your settings.

  -Don’t worry — connecting Notion Calendar and Notion doesn’t mean your company will have access to your calendars.



### Add Notion pages to your Notion Calendar event

When you create an event in Notion Calendar, you’ll see a `Docs and links` field in the event. Click into this field to add a Notion page, like an agenda, to the event details. From here, you can:

  -Make a new Notion page by selecting `Create Notion page` . Give your page a title and indicate where you want that page to live, and in which Notion workspace. Select `Create` when you’re done.

  -Choose an existing Notion page by searching for it, or selecting an option from `Recent Notion pages` . You can also switch between Notion workspaces if you have more than one connected to Notion Calendar.

  -Once you attach a Notion page to an event, you’ll be able to access it quickly and easily before a meeting, both from inside Notion Calendar and your menu bar.

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/5JLddr7e87l0d0LlE3porS/60df583a47c40685c8fcd9fd37e82baf/add_notion_db.mp4)

You might use Notion databases to track important deadlines or events in calendar or timeline view. You can bring these events directly into Notion Calendar so you can see all of these dates in one place! To add a Notion database:

  -At the bottom of the left sidebar of Notion Calendar, find the Notion workspace that contains the database you want to see in your calendar.

  -Hover over the calendar’s name, then select `•••` → `Add Notion database` . Search for and select the database you want to add to your calendar.

  -Dates from your database will appear in your calendar.

Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut `O` , or enter `cmd` + `K` and type “show Notion database”.

You can also add a Notion database to Notion Calendar from inside Notion. When you open a database with a date property in Notion, you’ll see the option to `Open in Calendar` .

Note:

  -You can only add a database while using Notion Calendar for desktop or web.

  -At the moment, you can only view your Notion database in Notion Calendar, not in Google Calendar.

  -You can add up to 10 databases to Notion Calendar.

  -While you can connect an existing Notion database to Notion Calendar, you can’t turn your Notion Calendar into a Notion database at this time.



### Add and edit Notion database entries in Notion Calendar

Note:To edit Notion databases from Notion Calendar, you’ll need edit access for the database.

To create a new database entry from inside Notion Calendar:

  -Select an open time slot in your calendar.

  -In the right context panel, enter the details for your database entry.

  -Open the dropdown menu and select your Notion database.

Need to make adjustments to Notion database items from within Notion Calendar? To do so:

  -Select a database item.

  -In the right context panel, change the title, date, and time of your event. You can even move the item to another calendar.

These changes will all be reflected in the original database in Notion.

Note:

  -If the dates for a database you connect to Notion Calendar are generated using the Formula, Created time, or Last edited time properties, those dates will be read-only in Notion Calendar. In other words, you can’t edit those dates from inside your calendar.

  -If you duplicate a Notion database item in Notion Calendar, a new page will be created in your Notion database with the same title and date, but it won’t duplicate any other content inside the original page.

  -If you move a database item from one workspace to another inside of Notion Calendar, a new page will be created in the destination workspace with the same title and date. The original page will be archived in the source Notion workspace and can berestored.



### Make a Notion database your default calendar

If you want all new events you create in Notion Calendar to be added to your Notion database, change your default calendar to the database. To do this, go to `Settings` → `Calendars` → `Default calendar` and pick the database you want to set as your default. On desktop, you can also set a default calendar by clicking the square next to the database’s name in the left sidebar.

### Upcoming events in Home

Your calendar events can be viewed and joined directly from inside Notion. In Notion, go to `Home` in your sidebar to view your Upcoming events widget. If you haven’t already used Notion Calendar with Notion, you’re logged out of Notion Calendar, or you’re using the widget in a new or different Notion workspace, you can select `Connect to Google Calendar` in the widget to set up your calendar.

Note:If you’re using Notion for desktop, you may be prompted to sign into your Notion account on the web to set up the Upcoming events widget.

This widget can be customized to show the calendars and events that you want — learn more inthis article.

Note:

  -You can connect multiple Notion Calendar accounts to the Upcoming events widget in Home.

  -If you’re in multiple Notion workspaces, don’t worry — you can adjust your Upcoming events widget differently for each!



### Disconnect Notion Calendar and Notion

You can unlink Notion Calendar and Notion from inside either app.

In Notion Calendar, go to `Settings` → `Notion` and select `Disconnect` beside the workspace you want to unlink.
