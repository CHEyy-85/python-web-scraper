<3. Pages & blocks>

At its simplest, Notion can be used as a straightforward text editor — but you can spruce up your Notion pages with all kinds of blocks that are flexible and customizable.



# Intro to writing & editing

### Notion is first and foremost a writing tool. It works as simply as any word processor, only you can add many different types of content to a page, and move it around and modify it in new ways ✏️

### Editing tools

There are three tools to familiarize yourself with in order to create any page you want.

  -+icon:Appears in the left margin whenever you hover over a new line. Click it to open a menu of content types you can add to your page.

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/3bjdTyaL3CYUEApNE0QeQm/ce2f5e706e8ea7a6ceec99d41f6bfc32/__button.mp4)

  -⋮⋮icon:This appears in the left margin whenever you hover over a new line or content block. Click and drag to move a block. Or click it to open a menu of actions. For example:

    *`Comment` : Lets you add a comment to the block.

    *`Suggest` : Lets you make a suggestion on the block.

    *`Duplicate` : Makes an exact copy of the content block.

    *`Turn into` : Transforms the block into another type of block (like a bullet into a checkbox, or plain text into a heading), or into a page.

    *`Copy link to block` : Copies the anchor link to this particular block.

    *`Move to` : Moves the block to another page in your workspace.

    *`Color` : Only appears for certain types of blocks to turn them into a different color or give them a background color — like text, files, and web bookmarks.

  -`/` commands:The easiest way to both add content to your page or apply any of the actions above (essentially a shortcut for the same functionality of the `+` and `⋮⋮` menus).

    *Type `/` followed by any type of block to add it. Examples: `/bullet` or `/heading` .

    *Type `/` followed by any action to apply it to the block. Examples: `/delete` or `/duplicate` .

    *Type `/` followed by the name of any color to change the color of the block. Like `/red` .

    *As soon as you type `/` a menu will pop up that you essentially search in real time for what you want. Just press `enter` to select it.

### Types of content

There are many different types of content blocks you can add to Notion, from bullet points to images to embeds to math equations. Here's a full list of content types, split into the same categories you'll find in our block menu (which can be opened with `/` or `+` ).

#### Basic blocks

  -`Text` : Just your regular old plain text!

  -`Page` : Adds a sub-page inside your page. You can put pages inside pages inside pages.

  -`To-do list` : Checkboxes for tasks and such. Shortcut `[]` .

  -`Heading 1` : The largest heading, can be easily added with shortcut `/h1` .

  -`Heading 2` : The medium-sized heading, can be easily added with shortcut `/h2` .

  -`Heading 3` : The smallest heading, can be easily added with shortcut `/h3` .

  -`Table:` Creates a simple set of columns and rows.

  -`Bulleted list` : Bullets. Shortcut `-` + `space` .

  -`Numbered list` : Indents your list and automatically generates the next number.

  -`Toggle List` : Creates toggles you can open to nest content and close to hide it. Shortcut `>` + `space` .

  -`Quote` : Creates larger text to break quotes out from the rest of your document.

  -`Divider` : Creates a thin gray line to break up text. Shortcut `---` .

  -`Link to page` : Creates a block that's a link to another page in your workspace.

  -`Callout` : Creates boxed text for tips, warnings, disclaimers, etc. With emoji!

#### Database

Add a database inline in the body of a Notion page. A great way to create a page that includes both writing and databases.Learn more about databases here →

  -`Table view` : Adds a table on your page.

  -`Board view` : Adds a kanban board on your page.

  -`Gallery view` : Adds a gallery on your page.

  -`List view` : Adds a list more minimal than a table to your page.

  -`Calendar view` : Adds a calendar on your page.

#### Media

There are several types of media you can add, view, and play (audio/video) right in Notion.

  -`Image` : Upload images or add images on your page.

  -`Video` : Upload your own file or embed from YouTube, Vimeo, etc.

  -`Audio` : Upload your own recording or embed from Spotify, Soundcloud, etc.

  -`File` : Upload any sort of file to a page to store it exactly where you want it.

  -`Code` : Add a block of code in any language, complete with formatting.

  -`Web bookmark` : Add a clickable link preview of a URL to your page.

#### Embeds

You can embed content from 500+ apps directly into Notion. We created shortcuts for a few of the most popular apps, but `/embed` works for nearly any other. Here are our named embeds:

  -`Google Drive` : Pull together Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc. right in your Notion page.

  -`Tweet` : Adds interactive/clickable tweets into your page ( `/tweet` + `enter` for example).

  -`GitHub Gist` : Embeds code, notes and snippets from Github.

  -`Google Maps` : Embeds an interactive Google Map in your page.

  -`Framer` : Embed a prototype from Framer into your page.

  -`Invision` : Embed a project from Invision.

  -`PDF` : You can either paste a link to a PDF or upload one to display it in full on your page.

  -`Figma` : Embed a Figma file so it appears in your page.

  -`Loom` : Embed a playable Loom recording in your page.

  -`Typeform` : Embed a survey that people can complete entirely in Notion.

  -`CodePen` : Embed code snippets from CodePen on your page.

  -`Whimsical` : Embed mind maps, flowcharts, wireframes, and sticky notes from Whimsical.

Type `/` followed by the name of any embed to add it. All of these will prompt you to input the URL for the embed you want.

#### Advanced blocks

  -`Inline equation` : Displays beautifully formatted mathematical characters and expressions.

  -`Button` : Lets you create and configure a button that replicates any combination of blocks you want over and over again.

  -`Breadcrumb` : Inserts an automatically generated breadcrumb menu that shows where the page you add it to lives in your workspace.

  -`Table of contents` : Adds a list of links to all the headings on your page.

#### Inline options

The content menu includes a few options that aren't technically blocks. Instead, they're `/` commands that will add several other types of content to your page. For dates or mentions, you can also `@` .

  -`Mention a person` : Gets the attention of someone else in your workspace.

  -`Mention a page` : Creates an inline link to another page in your workspace.

  -`Date or reminder` : Creates a dynamic timestamp or reminder that will trigger a notification.

  -`Emoji` : Brings up the emoji picker.

### Spell check

When you use Notion for web, your spelling will be checked by your browser’s spell check, and you’ll have to enable or disable spell check in your browser settings.

Notion for desktop has a built-in spell check that’s on by default. To turn this off:

  -Right-click a typo in a page.

  -In the menu that appears, select `Disable spell check` .

To turn spell check on in Notion for desktop:

  -Right-click a word on any page.

  -In the menu that appears, select `Enable spell check` .

### Style your writing

Here are the basics for styling your writing in Notion.Learn more about styling and customization here →

  -Notion is equipped with all the text styling features you've come to expect from any word processor — with a few more added in. Highlight any text to see the editing menu:

  -Choose from three different typography styles for every page you produce — selected to match most writing moods! Just click `•••` at the upper right of your page and pick `Default` , `Serif` , or `Mono` .

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/7FHtchTPxtgNlNyS39OVEC/07ca028fa02045182dd3263efbff1c17/switch_fonts.mp4)

  -To change text size, go to `•••` and switch on `Small text` .

  -You can shrink the margins on any page and widen your content area by going to `•••` at the top right of your Notion window and toggling on `Full width` .

### Arrange & modify content

Here are the basics for moving and structuring content around your page.

#### Select content

  -Click and drag from the left or right page margin to select an entire block of content, or multiple blocks at a time.

  -Click & drag fromwithina block to select, cut, copy & paste partial text across paragraphs, bullet lists, callouts & more — without having to select each block in its entirety.

  -If you're in editing mode within a block, press `Esc` to select the entire block.

Partial text selection across blocks will be supported on all platforms except Firefox. We’re actively working with the Mozilla team to enable this feature in Firefox as soon as possible.

#### Drag-and-drop

Any content block in Notion (including lines of text) can be dragged and dropped around the page. This includes rows in tables and cards in boards and galleries!

  -Hover over any block and use the `⋮⋮` icon that appears as a handle to drag it around.

  -Blue guides will appear to show you where it will go. (A good way to nest bullets and to-do's.)

  -Release your mouse to drop the block, table row, or card wherever you want it to go.

  -Drag-and-drop also works in your sidebar to reorder pages, nest pages inside pages, and move them between sections.

### Markdown & shortcuts

Notion supports many Markdown shortcuts.Learn more about keyboard shortcuts here →

While typing:

  -Type `**` on both sides of your text tobold.

  -Type `*` on both sides of your text toitalicize.

  -Type ``` on both sides of your text to create `inline code` . (That's the symbol to the left of your 1 key.)

  -Type `~` on both sides of your text to strikethrough.

At the beginning of any line of text, try these shortcuts:

  -Type `*` , `-` , or `+` followed by `space` to create a bulleted list.

  -Type `[]` to create a to-do checkbox. (There's no `space` in between.)

  -Type `1.` , `a.` , or `i.` followed by `space` to create a numbered list.

  -Type `#` followed by `space` to create an H1 heading.

  -Type `##` followed by `space` to create an H2 sub-heading.

  -Type `###` followed by `space` to create an H3 sub-heading.

  -Type `>` followed by `space` to create a toggle list.

  -Type `"` followed by `space` to create a quote block.

### Collaborative content

There are a couple of tools you can use while writing and editing that help with teamwork.

  -@-mention a person:Type `@` followed by one of your teammate's names to draw their attention to something on your page. You can do this inline in text or in a discussion or comment. The person will be notified to look at that part of your page.

  -Add a comment:You can add a comment to specific text by highlighting it and hitting the `💬` button or using the shortcut `cmd/ctrl` + `shift` + `m` .

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/3lya9QCLMWJpBj3YrPvSGy/4a30b1023bbf99aa34e9cf6a66a277ed/Block_comment.mp4)

### On mobile

The editing experience is pretty different on mobile than it is on desktop. There are no `/` commands. And no icons that appear on hover. Instead, all content is created from the editing toolbar located above your keyboard:

  -Double tap to select text, and drag your selection to include content across multiple blocks.

  -Tap the `+` to see a full menu of other content block types you can add to your page.

  -From this toolbar, you can also:

    *@-tag a person or page

    *Add a comment

    *Insert an image

    *Delete content

    *Indent or un-indent

    *Select text color and highlight

    *Delete and duplicate a block.

    *Copy a link to a block (under `•••` ).

Other editing options are located in the `•••` menu at the top right:

  -Style:Choose from three different typography choices to format your page.

  -Undo/Redo:Take back your last action on a page, or reinstate it.

### FAQs

Can I make Full width my default? Is there a way to set a default style for all pages?

Not yet, but a lot of users have asked for this! We're continuing to keep this in mind for future projects.

Can I justify text to be center aligned or right aligned?

Notion doesn't have any traditional alignment options at the moment, unfortunately 😕But you can still make this happen. Drag and drop an empty line into the column next to your text to align it to the right or left.

Is there a way to disable the menu that appears every time I type /?

There's no way to turn this off by default for now, but you can press `esc` as soon as it pops up in order to dismiss it.

How can I copy text from multiple blocks?

On desktop, click and drag from the left or right page margin to select an entire block of content, or multiple blocks at a time. Click & drag fromwithina block to select, cut, copy & paste partial text across paragraphs, bullet lists, callouts & more — without having to select each block in its entirety.

On mobile, double tap to select text, and drag your selection to include content across multiple blocks.





# Format your page

### Notion is designed to get thoughts out of your head and onto the page. Once they're there, you can rearrange, organize, and structure them to think and write more clearly 📐

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/7Frnrb6PPUqSvJkCFFo0uP/b5e06e56509feaae28d4e4a000676512/whatisablock3__1_.mp4)

### Columns

Sometimes, it makes sense to put pieces of information next to each other. In these situations, you can format your text into columns (or create side-by-side sections with headings) using drag and drop:

  -Click and drag the text you want to put in another column. (The `⋮⋮` symbol in the left margin is your handle for drag and drop.)

  -Follow the blue guides that appear.

  -Drop it where you want it. You just created a new column!

  -You can create as many columns as you want across the width of a page.

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/6CFjFyUvEruqchT7DZ9izL/0a26fa00742915b2f51f06671a9a0b54/column_creation.mp4)

Note:Columns are available on tablet but not mobile. On your phone, you'll see the content in any right-hand column simply placed under the content in the left column.



#### Remove columns

To remove columns, simply do the reverse of the action you took to create them.

  -Click the `⋮⋮` icon and hold to drag the content in your right-hand column back under or above the content in the left-hand column. When you see the blue guide span the width of the page, drop it and the columns should disappear.

  -Sometimes, it's possible to have an empty column. In this case, click the `⋮⋮` icon and select `Delete` . This also removes the column format.

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/54i7BlysTCS1AYVFslMWx/fdd5e6cd14ba91b781553f0d4cc85382/remove_columns.mp4)

Tip:You can resize columns by hovering over the edges they share with other content and dragging the gray vertical guides that appear left or right.

### Simple tables

Need to structure content in a visual matrix? Use a simple table!

  -Click the `+` in the left margin that appears when you hover over a new line, and select the `Table` option.

  -Or, type `/` followed by `table` and then `enter` .

  -To add or remove columns, hover over the right side of the table. Click and drag the `+` button.

  -To add or remove rows, hover over the bottom of the table. Click and drag the `+` button.

  -You can also drag the `+` button at the bottom right to add/remove rowsandcolumns at the same time!

  -Use the `Options` menu to toggle on row and column headers for additional visual distinction in the form of a colored header background.

  -Click the `←→` option to snap your table to page or column width!

#### Convert a simple table to a database

While a simple table lets you quickly visualize information, you can convert it to a database any time you need database functionality such as filters, sorts, or specific property value types.Learn more about databases here →

  -Click the `•••` menu hovering at the top of the simple table. Click `Turn into database` .

Tip:Not sure whether a simple table or a database is a better fit for your content?Check out this helpful guide comparing the two, with best practices on how to use each →

### Headings & subheadings

Using different sizes of headings throughout your writing gives your information more structure, context, and a sense of priority. Notion makes three sizes of headings available.

  -Click the `+` in the left margin that appears when you hover over a new line, and select the size heading you want. See the menu in the image below.

  -Type `/` followed by `h1` , `h2` , or `h3` and then `enter` .

  -Use Markdown and type `#` for H1, `##` for H2, or `###` for H3, then press `space` .

  -Type whatever you want. Then, press `cmd/ctrl` + `/` and choose a heading size to convert the text!

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/3HVip8XgcEoqQcYZrraMRN/82b86f85e85e0196be660f116ec1fe82/slash_command.mp4)

### Table of contents

If you're working on a long document with lots of headings, you may want to add a table of contents to help your readers and collaborators easily skim the page’s content and easily jump to any section.

In a table of contents, you’ll see a list of all the headings used in your page. H2s and H3s will be indented to reflect your page’s structure. Click on any of the headings in your table of contents to go to that heading in the page.

A table of contents can appear in a page in two ways:

  -At the top of your page, as a block.

  -At the right side of your page as you scroll through it, as a page-level setting.

#### Table of contents block

There are a few ways to add a table of contents block in Notion:

  -Hover over a new block on your page and select `+` . In the menu that appears, find and select `Table of contents` .

  -Enter `/` in a page and start typing `table of contents` . Select `Table of contents` in the menu that appears.

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/48X8fziwxCKbwmbqd2N9lH/4bf95f7292cf65f6dbb6c67890d590a4/add_table_of_contents.mp4)

Note:Your table of contents block is a single unit that must be moved, deleted, duplicated, and styled as a unit. To edit the text it contains, edit the actual headings on your page.

#### Table of contents page-level setting

You’ll see a table of contents in the right side of your Notion page by default if your page has two or more headings. This table of contents will follow you as you scroll through the page so you can access it at any time. Hover over the table of contents to expand it and see all of the headings in your page.

If you don’t want to see a page-level table of contents:

  -In the page you want to remove the table of contents from, select `•••` .

  -Toggle off `Table of contents` .

### Dividers

Breaking up content on a page can help you separate distinct sections and ideas. Dividers are a good way to distinguish these sections and add some stylistic flair to your page.

  -Click the `+` in the left margin that appears when you hover over a new line and select the `Divider` block from the menu.

  -Type `/` followed by `div` and then `enter` .

  -Type `---` (three hyphens in a row) and a divider will automatically pop up.

  -You can drag and drop these dividers just like any other block on your page.

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/7u70eRd5zfdJ8PUcLC9Ede/37e0d6a037de9fa9118578fbc4b4296f/divider.mp4)



### FAQs

Why can't I see columns on my phone or tablet?

Unfortunately, our mobile apps don't support multiple columns yet, but it's definitely on our to-do list!

Will my table of contents show titles of in-line tables on my page?

No. Even if you give your table a name in your document, this won't be reflected in the table of contents. You can, however, add a heading above the database that will appear.

If I turn individual headings a color, will that show in my table of contents?

Your table of contents will always be all one color 🖌You can change this color, and it will will apply to the whole thing. To do this:

  -Click the `⋮⋮` icon that appears when you hover over your table of contents. Or select it and hit `cmd/ctrl` + `/` . Or right click.

  -Choose `Color` from the menu that pops up and select which color or highlight you want.



Can I edit the text inside my table of contents?

Not directly! In order to change the text it displays, edit the individual heading blocks in your page.

  -This same menu includes the `Small text` toggle. When you turn it on, the text on your page shrinks. Helpful if you want to fit more on a page or if you like the way it looks.

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/3L32EcLaAGKKZ2RyexB0Qo/f98be3065b8e10e2ed931aa121a9895a/small_text.mp4)

### Colors

Spice up your text by turning it a color or giving it a color highlight. There are many colors to choose from and several ways to apply them:

  -Give in-line text a color or highlight from the same menu you'd use to bold, italicize or comment — just highlight any text and choose a color from the `A` dropdown:

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/EBaP61Azr1TgpqH2h2s9a/91f34cf6c16ae4b4352cc01f35d4d055/change_text_color.mp4)

  -You can also turn an entire block of text the same color. The easiest way to do this is to type that handy `/` followed by the name of the color you want to write in, like /red.

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/53xm0DtatGp6GqL3p2rC9y/0ac31c06ba22f62045a6c7918b30946b/change_block_color.mp4)

  -You can also change the color of a text block by typing `cmd/ctrl` + `/` at any point and then the name of the color you want followed by `enter` .

Tip:Using the same color over and over? Apply the last color you used with the shortcut `cmd/ctrl` + `shift` + `H` .



### Page width

You can shrink the margins on any page and widen your content area by going to `•••` at the top right of your Notion window and toggling on `Full width` .

### Customize backlinks & comments

The top of any page in Notion can include two things: backlinks and comments.

  -Backlinks indicate all the pages that link to the current page so you can easily navigate between them.

  -Comments capture conversation between you and your teammates. You can use them to tag each other, ask questions, provide feedback and more.

As with everything in Notion, you can customize the look and feel of these components. To access these options:

  -Click the `•••` button at the top right of any Notion page and select `Customize page` .

  -You'll see this window pop up:

  -For backlinks, you can choose:

    *Expanded:See all the pages that link to the current page listed in full.

    *Show in popover:In case you don't want to see all the pages, you can choose to see just the number of backlinks. Click to open a popup displaying all the pages.

    *Off:Just hide all backlinks entirely.

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/3SjVrTSn2OQe6uHy1N7QhF/c938cb3158abcaab8efec6011e38b02f/customize_backlinks.mp4)

  -For comments, you can choose to show them:

    *Expanded:Show the full conversation at the top of the page.

    *Off:Hide comments on the page for a minimalist view.

### Callouts

Callout blocks are useful for highlighting specific text or breaking it out from the rest of a document. Perhaps you want to draw attention to a warning or a tip.

#### Add a callout

You can add a callout to a page in a few ways:

  -Hover over a new block and select `+` to the left of the block → `Callout` .

  -Type `/callout` in your page and press `enter` .

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/6pOIPSj971TgfZmUtast8j/ee2eab5626219508005c8957abb1efe6/add_callout.mp4)

You can move your callout block around your page by hovering over it and using the `⋮⋮` that appears as a handle to drag and drop it. Callouts can even be placed in a column.

#### Style your callout

  -Your callout block can contain other block types like bullets and headings. You can drag these blocks around to rearrange them within your callout.

    *Note that if you use headings in your callout, those headings will appear in your page'stable of contents.

Every page, whether it's a database or not, can have its own icon — either an emoji or an image you upload yourself (like your logo). It'll appear at the top left of your page and in the sidebar next to it. This helps make pages memorable and easy to find.

There are a few ways to add page icons:

  -Hover over the top of any page and click `Add icon` .

  -You can also click `🔀` to cycle through randomly chosen emojis 'til you like one!

  -To remove an icon, just click on it and choose `Remove` .

  -Ideal icon images are 280 x 280 pixels.

### FAQs

Can I make Full width my default? Is there a way to set a default style for all pages?

Not yet, but a lot of users have asked for this! We're continuing to keep this in mind for future projects.

Can I justify text to be center aligned or right aligned?

Notion doesn't have any traditional alignment options at the moment, unfortunately 😕But you can still make this happen. Drag and drop an empty line into the column next to your text to align it to the right or left.

Why can't I change text size on mobile?

This styling option, along with page width, only exists on desktop and web.

What's the ideal size and aspect ratio for cover images?

The cover images are dynamic depending on the width of your window, so there's no specific size that works best. That said, we recommend using images at least 1,500 pixels wide.

How can I insert an emoji in-line with my text 🤔?

Anywhere in your text, type `:` followed by the name of the emoji you want to use, like `:fire` for 🔥 or `:clapping` for 👏

You can also use your system emoji picker to include emojis in-line on a Notion page, or anywhere else on your computer!

Mac: `ctrl` + `cmd` + `space`

Windows 10: `windows key` + `.` or `windows key` + `;`

### Backlinks

Backlinks show you all the pages that link to the page you’re currently on. You can use these to navigate your workspace.

Backlinks are created automatically every time you @-mention a page. To see a page’s backlinks, select `{#} backlinks` under its title, or its properties if it’s a database page.

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/5oTpxjGKNJirIDMXBUXCRF/0d9467ee3dedb8c756c3a4ed904a5afb/backlinks.mp4)

### FAQs

How do I automatically open Notion links in the desktop app?

  -Click on `Settings & members` in your sidebar.

  -Select `My settings` .

  -Toggle on `Open links in desktop app` .



What's the difference between @-mentioning a page, and adding a Link to page block?

`Link to page` works kind of like creating a sub-page. When you reference a Notion page this way, it will show up in your sidebar as a subpage of the page where it was linked.

@-mentioning a page creates something more like a hyperlink. Pages you @-mention won’t show up as subpages of the pages they’ve been mentioned in.



# Wikis & verified pages

### Utilize the power of a database to better maintain important information about your organization in a centralized location ✅

Sometimes it can be hard to get a detailed overview of everything going on with your team's documents. Wikis, page owners, and verified pages can help you quickly get the broad strokes of pages without needing to deep dive.

### Create a wiki

To turn a page into a wiki:

  -Click the `•••` menu in the top right corner.

  -Select `Turn into wiki` . (If you don’t see this option, it might be because you’re trying to turn a database into a wiki, which is not possible.)

To undo turning a page into a wiki:

  -Click the `•••` menu in the top right corner.

  -Select `Undo wiki` .

There are three default views of a wiki. You can create additional views, including views with other layouts like a calendar, timeline, or list.

  -`Home` : Default wiki view that can be customized like any standard Notion page.

  -`All pages` : Database view of all the pages within this wiki. Best for getting a broad view of documents.

  -`Pages I own` : Database view showing just pages where you are the owner.

  -Click on the current owner’s name

  -Search or select the new owner’s name

Or, from a database view:

  -Even if you or someone on your team restores a past version, you can always go back to the page as it was during any point in the past 30 days. Just open `Version history` again, choose the version you want to return to, and restore it.

#### Version history on mobile

Version history works a bit differently on mobile that it does on the web or desktop. To access page history:

  -Click the `•••` icon at the top of your page.

  -Tap `Version history` . You'll see a full list of versions organized by time.

    *Tap any version to view it. You can copy and paste any content you want from it into your current version, or tap `Restore` at the top of the screen to make that version current.

### Delete pages

There are many ways to delete pages in Notion. Here are all of them:

  -Hover over the page in your left sidebar, click the `•••` icon that appears (or right click) and select `Delete` from the menu.

  -Go to the `•••` icon at the very top right of a page and select `Delete` from the dropdown menu.

  -If you're deleting a sub-page off of an existing page, hover over it and click on the⋮⋮icon (or right click) to see the option to delete.

  -Drag any page or content block into the `Trash` at the bottom of your left sidebar.

  -You can always select any page block and press the `backspace` or `delete` keys.

### Find pages in trash

Note:By default, pages will remain in Trash for 30 days before they are automatically removed from Trash. Enterprise plan workspace owners may customize these settings.Learn more here →

You'll see `Trash` at the bottom of your left sidebar on both desktop and mobile. When you delete a page, this is where it ends up. Once you open `Trash` , you can:

  -Search for a specific page.

  -Filter by the following:

    *`Last edited by` : The last person to edit the page.

    *`In` : The page that the deleted content used to live in.

    *`Teamspace` : The teamspace that the deleted content used to belong to.

  -Open a deleted page to see its contents. From there, you can restore the page or permanently delete it from the trash.Note that you won’t be able to edit a page that’s in the trash unless you restore it.

On both iOS and Android, `Trash` is located in the `•••` menu in the top left of the sidebar.



### FAQs

I tried duplicating some blocks, but got a Please try again later error.

This error means that you've hit our duplication rate limit — right now you can only duplicate 20,000 blocks per hour. Our apologies for the incovenience!

If you wait a bit, you'll be able to duplicate the content then 👍

What if I accidentally deleted something permanently? Any way to get it back?

If you accidentally delete a page, a workspace, or even your entire account, we can help! Accidents happen 😅 Just send us a message in the app by clicking `?` at the bottom left on desktop (or in your sidebar on mobile). Or email us atteam@makenotion.com.

We keep backups of our database, which allows us to restore a snapshot of your content in the past 30 days if you need it.

How can I empty my trash?

There isn’t a way to empty your trash all at once. You can go in and delete individual pages from the trash — otherwise, pages in the trash will be automatically and permanently deleted after 30 days.

Enterprise plan workspace owners may customize these settings.Learn more here →

### Add a math equation inline

Just like you can format text in Notion asbold, strikethrough, or `code notation` , you can also format your text as a math equation, like this quadratic formula:

There are a few different ways to add math equations inline, and all are keyboard friendly.

With text shortcuts:

  -Type two dollar signs, followed by your equation. When you close your formula with two more dollar signs, it will turn into an equation.

With the equation input:

  -To open the equation input, use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl/cmd` + `shift` + `E` .

  -Type your equation into the input, and press `enter` .

[Video](//videos.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/50Jd8vzLQkCjBWPJYJYtxz/548e13d3854a1c502c16fb5fe3866f94/Inline_math_shortcut.mp4)

With the formatting menu:

  -Highlight an equation in your paragraph.

  -Click the `√x` button in the formatting menu that appears, or use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl/cmd` + `shift` + `E` . Your selected text should turn into an equation.

### Recognized symbols

Notion supports the full scope of symbols and operations within the \KaTeX language. For a full list of supported functions, please visit the links below:

Supported Functions · KaTeX

Support Table · KaTeX

Note:KaTeX spans most, but not all mathematical notation supported by LaTeX. If your equation isn't rendering correctly in Notion, please visit the links above to see if that function is supported.



### FAQs

I don't know LaTeX but want to use Notion's equations. How can I get started?

It's easy to get started using LaTeX for homework, class notes, or lab reports. Basic arithmetic and variable names are valid in LaTeX already.

If you just need to look up specific symbols,Detexifyis a great resource that allows you to draw the symbol and look up the corresponding LaTeX code.

To learn more powerful LaTeX, Overleafdocumentationis a great place to learn the basics:

  -Mathematical expressions

  -Subscripts and superscripts

  -Brackets and Parentheses

  -Matrices

  -Fractions and Binomials

  -Aligning Equations

  -Operators

  -Spacing in math mode

  -Integrals, sums and limits

  -Display style in math mode

  -List of Greek letters and math symbols

  -Mathematical fonts

Note that Overleaf is a full-featured LaTeX editor, so not everything in the documentation is supported in Notion. If in doubt, you can always check this list ofSupported Functionsor alphabetizedSupport Tableto determine which functions are supported.

Why can't I render a specific equation? What formulas/libraries do you support? Can you add support for a formula or library I want to use?

Notion uses theKaTeXlibrary to render equations. KaTeX supports a large subset of LaTeX, documented on their list ofSupported Functionsand alphabetized in thisSupport Table. To request support for new functions or environments, you can open an issue on theKaTeX GitHub project.

I'm trying to use the align environment and it's not working!

From theCommon Issuespage of the KaTeX documentation:

"KaTeX does not support the `align` environment because LaTeX doesn't support `align` in math mode. The `aligned` environment offers the same functionality but in math mode, so use that instead."

Can I use inline equations for superscript and subscript?

It's possible to use inline equations for superscript and subscript, but it does mean that the text will be an equation, in "equation font."

  -Use `^` to designate superscript, for example: `x^2`

  -Use `_` to designate subscript, for example: `H_2O`

If there are multiple characters that you want to include in superscript or subscript, wrap them in curly brackets. For example: `23^{rd}`



What happens when I copy/paste inline LaTeX?

It will give you the source code.

How do I use Notion for chemistry?

Notion supports the `\\ce` and `\\pu` chemical equation macros from themhchemextension. These shortcuts allow you to typeset beautiful chemical and mathematical equations quickly and easily.

How do I convert between inline and block equations?

If you have a block containing an inline equation, you can use the "Turn into" menu to make it a block equation.
