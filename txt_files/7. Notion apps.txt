<7. Notion apps>

You can use Notion on desktop, web, or mobile. Read on to explore the differences and get the most out of Notion on each platform.



# Notion for desktop

### You can use Notion on your Mac or PC as a downloadable desktop application. Here's what you need to know üñ•Ô∏è

### Why use the desktop app?

Notion's desktop app is a clean, distraction-free interface without all the temptation of tabs. Switching between tabs in the desktop app is smooth and quick so that you can work more efficiently.You can even hover over a tab to preview the page inside it.

You'll receive push notifications in the desktop app when something important happens inside Notion, like when someone mentions you, someone assigns you a task, or you set a reminder for yourself.

#### New Tab Search

Navigating to a new page is quick and easy in the desktop app. With Notion for desktop, you can set every new tab you create to open up a search window. From the search window that opens when you open a new tab, you can:

  -Look for and quickly navigate to the page you want.

  -Open a new page or start a chat with Notion AI in a new tab in just one click.

  -Jump to an existing tab.

New Tab Search will be turned on by default, but if you‚Äôd like to turn this off:

  -Go to `Settings & members` ‚Üí `My settings` .

  -Toggle off `New Tab Search` . If this setting is toggled off, new tabs will display the default page specified in the `Open on start` setting.

#### Command Search

On desktop, you can use search andQ&Aeven when you‚Äôre outside of the Notion app. Trigger Command Search with a customizable keyboard shortcut, your menu bar on Mac, or your task bar on Windows so you can search or ask Q&A without switching between windows or bringing the Notion desktop app to the foreground. To make it easier to access Notion this way, a few things will happen by default:

  -Command Search will be turned on. To turn this off, go to `Settings & members` ‚Üí `My settings` ‚Üí toggle off `Enable Command Search` . You can also turn off `Show Notion in Menu Bar` or customize your `Command Search shortcut` .

  -Notion will be set to open at login. To turn this off:

    *On Mac: Right-click on the Notion icon in the dock ‚Üí select `Options` ‚Üí `Open at Login` to remove the check mark beside it.

    *On Windows: Right-click on the Notion icon in the task bar ‚Üí select `Launch Preferences` ‚Üí `Open Notion at Login` to remove the check mark beside it.

### FAQs

I tried using the web clipper on mobile, but got an error message This app is not supported.

Unfortunately, Notion Web Clipper only works for entire pages from your web browser, or photos from your photo roll. It doesn't support other apps yet, like the Twitter app or the iOS Notes app. Definitely possible in the future though!

I tried clipping a web page with the Web Clipper, but some of the page content is missing.

Oops, sorry about that üôà If you wouldn't mind sharing the URL with us atteam@makenotion.com, we'd be happy to flag to our engineering team so they can tweak the clipper accordingly.

Can you add tags to a web page while clipping it?

Not at the moment, unfortunately. Definitely possible for a future iteration though ‚úÇÔ∏è

For the time being, you'll need to open the clipped page in a Notion database to add and edit any tags or other database properties.

I installed the Safari extension, but am seeing long loading spinners when I try to use it.

Unfortunately, some Safari configurations seem to be causing performance issues across many different Safari extensions, including Notion's. To help our engineering team debug this issue with Apple, could you let us know:

  -What version of macOS are you running on your computer?

  -In the Safari ‚Üí About Safari window, which version number of Safari are you running on your computer?

  -In the Safari ‚Üí Settings... ‚Üí Extensions, which version number of the Notion Web Clipper do you have installed?
