# Duplicate public pages

### You can duplicate public Notion pages to add them to your own workspace. From there, you can customize them however you want üëØ

We've made a huge update to templates! Learn more here:

  -The ultimate guide to Notion templates



### Duplicate a page

Let's say you come across a Notion page you love on the web and want to make it your own.

  -Log into Notion on your browser.

  -Navigate to the public page and click `Duplicate` in its upper right corner.

  -Choose the workspace you'd like to duplicate the page into from the dropdown.

  -Your browser will take you to that page, now duplicated into the `Private` section of your sidebar. It will include all the sub-pages contained in the original page.

  -You can edit this page and its sub-pages just like you would any other.

### Prevent duplication

If you have a public page that you don't want duplicated, you can turn that option off.

  -Go to the page in Notion and click `Share` .

  -Underneath `Share to the web` , switch off the toggle labeled `Allow duplicate as template` (it's on by default).
